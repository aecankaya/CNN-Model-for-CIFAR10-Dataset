# CNN-Model-for-CIFAR10-Dataset
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the Cifar10 dataset. The Cifar10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

You can inspect, change and train the model with Cifar10_CNN_Model.ipynb .

Also, you can use cifar10_model.h5 file if you want to use weights of my trained model which is the best model according to the lowest validation loss value up to 40 epochs with 0.483 validation loss and 0.8396 validation accuracy.
